# About Me
Hello! My name is Kenneth and I live in Shanghai, China. I spend time exploring my interest but I am not sure what I want to do in the future. For now, I love IMA and I want to explore the combination of art and technology, which is what IMA does. I can speak English and Chinese. I took interaction lab last semester and I made one interactive product and one escaping game on computer. I am so proud of my achievement in last semester. I hope that I can continue to make some fantastic project in App Lab and I am looking forward to join the final IMA show.

I am sophomore now. Joining the big family of NYU Shanghai is the best choice I have ever made. I will never be regret for this amazing decesion. In this building in Lujiazui. I have met many good friends and staffs, excellent professors and fellows. I meet what I love--IMA and make up my mind to do something different with IMA skills in the future. 

For this semester, I also take VR/AR Fundmentals because I am really interested in VR and AR. I think they are the future. With the development of 5g tehcnology, I think that AR/VR can be used in real production and they can be key roles in some area. I hope that I can take away something from this class and I really want to make a great AR/VR project. That will be terrific if I can have a chance to do some undergraduated research and create a new things.

I am really happy to be in App Lab and have Christian to be my teacher and friend. I think I will have a good time in App Lab this semester!
